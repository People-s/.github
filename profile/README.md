Connect
with people with similar interests & ideas
and become a part of the next-gen Social Media by participating in creating the future.

Our mission
is to attract people of web 2.0 to web 3.0 with the limitless ownership possibilities and flexibility
harness the power of blockchain by forming token gated communities
  
  
<br>
<br>
  
<h3>
How we built it
</h3>

<br>
<br>


Overall the idea was to build Social Media Platform for crypto users which are more advanced and to get to know new users how crypto world works.So we made it easier for new users to login and make account even if they where not in contact with web3 world by usin Sequence wallet which generates EVM compatible wallet address with just loging in withe-mail or social media credentials.

<br>
<br>

<h3>
Challenges we ran into
</h3>

<br>
<br>

For users of web3 and owners of NFT's we made an option that them can make special channels inside of platform with specific platform parameteres and conditions to be able to join it. Users which are new to web3 and do not vote or participate in channel have option to read-only channels. If they vote or particpate and claim ownership of specific NFT or token they have option to join the channel.
One of features that we integrate it inside of platform is Livepeer protocol which gives users posibility to pload videos and use live chat inside of channel.

<br>
<br>

Most importantly delivering the working product, even thought it can be improved we have definitely created a new paradigm and solved a lot of the problems on the way.


<br>
<br>
  
<h3>
What we learned
</h3>

<br>
<br>



One of the most important lessons where topics related to Chainlink nodes, adapters, configuration of the Chainlink Keepers, Data Feeds and many other related topics.

<br>
<br>

<h3>
What's next for Map of Crypto
</h3>

<br>
<br>



We really do hope to start a new movement in the web3 dapps, as with our application we let users exchange different types of goods, no matter where they live, and eventually let them pay with a single currency. Our biggest dream related to this project, is making it a full-scale working products, for masses, which would start a completely new trend in the crypto world.

## Future plan for integrations and colaboration

<br>
<br>

<div align="left">

Future intentions of integrations are gateway payment something like MoonPay or Transak that users can directly buy crypto with fiat.
Integration with some brands and providers of selling services and also colaboration with them.
Reconstruction and better UI on dashboard visualy with extra functionality.
<br>
As we use Google API for maps maybe use some paid service in order to get better data about locations and users.
Usage of Google services in order to get better customer support for users.
Adding section on dashboard where users can make profiles and list as many items as they can.
Process of verification system to be more trustfull and protect users rights something like Idenfy or Veriff.
Also adding posibility for users to easy connect with multiple wallets on supported chains.
Some tool which will give users ability to see where is data about their items they listed on IPFS.
Customer support chat integartion (Matrix, Wickr)
As we developed tracking id number which gets from Chainlink node we should consider connecting that data with some Digital Marketing tool in order that user gets confirmation e-mail.
Also 2FA service for better safety measuers and protection of users privacy.
